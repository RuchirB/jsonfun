The only script that you should be running is newslensScriptMain.py. This file does rely on importing 'dateTimeModule.py', so make sure this is downloaded as well. Here are some example commands you can enter, 
but most variations of these commands still work:

"What's new" - gives you the top three stories

"Story Name" - Elaborates on story

"People" - Gives you the prominent voices of the story

"Last 10 events" - gives you last ten headlines

"History" - Gives you your local history of viewing stories

category_name - Gives you a list of stories under that category
